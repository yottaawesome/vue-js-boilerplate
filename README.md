# Vue JS Boilerplate

## Introduction

A minimal boilerplate repo with Vue based upon the Vue CLI version, but with updated dependencies.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run start` to start the local server.

You can optionally use `docker-compose` to start up a container that builds and watches the files. Note that the watch functionality does not work on Windows due to limitations that [prevent changes to files on a Windows host from being propagated to containers](https://forums.docker.com/t/file-system-watch-does-not-work-with-mounted-volumes/12038/20).

## Additional commands

* `npm run build`: Compiles and minifies for production.
* `npm run lint`: Lints and fixes files.
